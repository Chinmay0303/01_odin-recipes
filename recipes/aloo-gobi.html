    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Aloo gobi is a traditional Indian dish made of spiced cauliflower and potatoes. This dish is 
        steamed and then fried in oil, making it intentionally dry and somewhat crispy. Warning: This 
        dish is extremely spicy, which is the way I like it. However, if you don't want your food that 
        spicy, feel free to cut down on the serrano pepper and/or cayenne pepper. Also, I recommend 
        serving this with a side of raita or plain yogurt to cool the mouth down after eating.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>onion</li>

        <li>paprika</li>
        <li>baking potatoes</li>
        <li>cauliflower</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds; cook until turn golden brown and begin to pop, a few seconds. Reduce heat to medium. Add onion; cook until lightly browned. Stir in serrano chiles and ginger paste; cook 1 minute. Season with coriander, turmeric, cayenne, garam masala, and paprika; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds.
            </li>
        <li>Add potatoes and salt to the pot; cover and cook 5 to 7 minutes. Add cauliflower; cover and steam in its own juices until tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil around edges of the pot. Increase heat to medium-high; cook to brown, 3 to 5 minutes, stirring gently to avoid mashing cauliflower.
            </li>
